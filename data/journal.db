{"_id":"8ObXZhQcwUQC8xv9","name":"Drinking Games","content":"<h1>Drinking Contest</h1>\n<p>A drinking contest is the most straightforward type of drinking game: everyone drinks until they pass out; last one sitting upright wins. Participants in a drinking contest take turns selecting drinks (or rolling for them randomly), which each participant must then drink simultaneously.</p>\n<p>A participant is eliminated when they vomit or fall unconscious. A particularly chaotic version of a direct drinking contest substitutes ordinary drinks with magical ones (sometimes to the chagrin of unwary participants). Players which are petrified, polymorphed into a chicken, planeshifted to a different level of the multiverse, or otherwise rendered unable to drink are eliminated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Skilled Drinking Games</h1>\n<p>Practically any skillful drinking game can be represented with opposed skill contests by the players involved. Games like quarters or darts can be represented by opposed Dexterity checks between two or more players, with losing parties each consuming a drink. Other games (such as a drinking game of chess) might involve opposed Intelligence checks, where others still might involve Charisma or Wisdom checks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Random Drinking Games</h1>\n<p>Other drinking games, such as King’s Cup, are fundamentally random, and require no skill on the part of the players. In such a game, participants take turns rolling any die. On an odd number, they drink. </p>","folder":"vAtD5P9Yez2cdabu","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":0,"41TSSd9YeKXEC1w6":3},"flags":{}}

Therefore, it is governed by a special condition known as drunkenness, which is measured in 10 levels. A drink can give a creature one or more levels of drunkenness, as specified in the drink’s description.</p>\n<p>A creature immune to being poisoned can’t become drunk, and one with advantage on saving throws against being poisoned has advantage on saves against becoming drunk as well.</p>\n<p>If an already drunk creature suffers another effect that causes drunkenness, its current level of drunkenness increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of drunkenness as well as all lower levels.</p>\n<p>An effect that removes drunkenness reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all effects ending if a creature’s drunkenness level is reduced below 1.</p>\n<p>Each hour that passes reduces a creature’s drunkenness by 1 level. Moreover, finishing a long rest drops a creature’s drunkenness to 0. If the creature’s drunkenness level was 5 or higher, they instead suffer the poisoned condition (as well as a blinding headache) for 4 hours.</p>","img":"","folder":"vAtD5P9Yez2cdabu","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"41TSSd9YeKXEC1w6":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.rules.apBZudO4UA1wj7aC"}}}
